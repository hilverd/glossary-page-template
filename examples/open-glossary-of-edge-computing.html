                        <dd>The sub-layer of the Service Provider Edge closest to the physical last mile networks, zero or one hops from the RAN or cable headend. For example, an edge data center deployed at a cellular network site. The Access Edge Layer functions as the front line of the Service Provider Edge and typically connects to the Regional Edge layer upstream in the hierarchy. Edge compute at the Access Edge consists of highly-distributed server-class infrastructure located at front- and mid-haul sites, such as cell towers, cable distribution plants, aggregation and pre-aggregation hubs,central offices, and other facilities which house network access equipment such as cellular radio base stations, as well as xDSL and xPON equipment. Access Edge data centers are often of the micro-modular variety because of their ease of deployment and self-contained operation. Because of the need to support ultra-low-latency workloads, including those that require a predictable connection to the last mile network, Access Edge facilities are typically sited within 15km of the radio heads or cable head ends and are best used for workloads that require latencies in the sub-1ms - 30ms range.</dd>

It is synonymous with the term Edge Cloud as defined in this glossary. It has also been used interchangeably with Edge Data Center and Edge Node in the literature. In a 3-tier computing architecture, the term &quot;cloudlet&quot; refers to the middle tier (Tier 2), with Tier 1 being the cloud and Tier 3 being a smartphone, wearable device, smart sensor or other such weight/size/energy-constrained entity. In the context of CDNs such as Akamai, cloudlet refers to the practice of deploying self-serviceable applications at CDN nodes.</dd>

                        <dd>A cloud native network function (CNF) is a cloud native application that implements network functionality. A CNF consists of one or more microservices and has been developed using Cloud Native Principles including immutable infrastructure, declarative APIs, and a “repeatable deployment process”. An example of a simple CNF is a packet filter that implements a single piece of network functionality as a microservice. A firewall is an example of a CNF which may be composed of more than one microservice (i.e. encryption, decryption, access lists, packet inspection, etc.).</dd>

                        <dd>An evolution of the RAN that allows the functionality of the wireless base station to be split into two components: A Remote Radio Head (RRH) and a centralized BBU. Rather than requiring a BBU to be located with each cellular radio antenna, C-RAN allows the BBUs to operate at some distance from the tower, at an aggregation point, often referred to as a Distributed Antenna System (DAS) Hub. Co-locating multiple BBUs in an aggregation facility creates infrastructure efficiencies and allows for a more graceful evolution to Cloud RAN. In a C-RAN architecture, tasks performed by a legacy base station are often performed as VNFs operating on infrastructure edge micro data centers on general-purpose compute hardware. These tasks must be performed at high levels of performance and with as little latency as possible, requiring the use of infrastructure edge computing at the cellular network site to support them.</dd>

Computational offloading seeks, for example, performance improvements and energy savings for mobile devices by offloading computation to the infrastructure edge with the goal of minimizing task execution latency and mobile device energy consumption. Computational offloading also enables new classes of mobile applications that would require computational power and storage capacity that exceeds what the device alone is capable of employing (e.g., untethered Virtual Reality). In other cases, workloads may be offloaded from a centralized to an edge data center for performance. The term is also referred to as cloud offload and cyber foraging in the literature.</dd>

Edge native applications are developed in ways that leverage the cloud and work in concert with upstream resources. Edge applications that don’t comprehend centralized cloud compute resources, remote management and orchestration or leverage CI/CD aren’t truly “edge native”, rather they more closely resemble traditional on-premises applications. A traditional SCADA application within a nuclear power plant that has no connection to the cloud would not be considered an Edge-Native Application.

Formalized in 2014, MEC seeks to augment 4G and 5G wireless base stations with a standardized software platform, API and programming model for building and deploying applications at the edge of the wireless networks. MEC allows for the deployment of services such as radio-aware video optimization, which utilizes caching, buffering and real-time transcoding to reduce congestion of the cellular network and improve the user experience. Originally known as Mobile Edge Computing, the ETSI working group renamed itself to Multi-Access Edge Computing in 2016 in order to acknowledge their ambition to expand MEC beyond cellular to include other access technologies. Utilizes edge data centers deployed at the infrastructure edge.</dd>

                        <dd>A subcategory of the Service Provider Edge consisting of server-class infrastructure located in regional data centers which also tend to serve as major peering sites. Regional edge sites are commonly in the form of Multi-Tenant Colocation (MTCO) facilities owned by companies like Equinix and Digital Realty, but can also take the form of a backhaul facility owned by a telco network that has been upgraded to house server-class IT equipment. Regional Edge sites usually provide, also, a regional Internet Exchange (IX) point, where tenants can connect to other networks and reach nationwide Internet backbones. Large cloud providers, web-scale companies, CDNs and other enterprises place servers and storage in these facilities to reduce the latency and network hops that would otherwise be required to reach a centralized data center, but which do not require the ultra low-latencies available at the Access Edge or at the User Edge. A rich confluence of data passes through these locations. Edge computing resources in a regional data center can work in conjunction with resources at the Access Edge and the User Edge to deliver different tiers of latency. As a general rule, Regional Edge data centers are capable of supporting edge workloads that can tolerate latencies in the 30ms - 100ms range.</dd>

                        <dd>A subcategory of the User Edge consisting of compute hardware located outside physically-secure data centers but still capable of supporting virtualization and/or containerization technologies for cloud-native software development. These resources span consumer-grade mobile devices and PCs to hardened, headless gateways and servers that are deployed for IoT use cases, such as in challenging environments that include factory floors, building equipment rooms, farms and weatherproof enclosures distributed within a city (see IoT Edge). While capable of general-purpose compute, these devices are performance-constrained for various reasons including cost, battery life, form factor and ruggedization (both thermal and physical) and therefore have a practical limit on processing expandability when compared to resources in an upstream data center. There is an increasing trend for these systems to feature co-processing in the form of Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) or Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) to accelerate analytics, with the added benefit of distributing thermal dissipation which is beneficial in extreme environments. Resources at the Smart Device Edge can be deployed and used as separate devices (e.g., a smartphone or IoT gateway on a factory floor) or they can be embedded into distributed, self-contained systems such as connected/autonomous vehicles, kiosks, oil wells and wind turbines.</dd>

                        <dd>A virtual entity constructed from multiple physical edge data centers such that they can be considered externally as one. Within the virtual data center, workloads can be intelligently placed within specific edge data centers or availability zones as required based on load balancing, failover or operator preference. In such a configuration, edge data centers are interconnected by low-latency networking and are designed to create a redundant and resilient edge computing infrastructure.</dd>

This script starts a simple server listening on localhost.

* GET requests are served by local HTML/JS/CSS files.
* PATCH requests to / expect to receive an HTML fragment string in the body.
  This string is used to update the glossary file, replacing

This allows the editor to save any updates made in the UI.
