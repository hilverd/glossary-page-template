                        <dd>An Act of Parliament (also called a statute) is a law made by the UK Parliament.

All Acts start as bills introduced in either the Commons or the Lords. When a bill has been agreed by both Houses of Parliament and has been given Royal Assent by the Monarch, it becomes an Act.

Acts are known as ‘primary legislation’ because they do not depend on other legislative authority.</dd>

                        <dd>An adjournment motion is literally a motion: &#39;That this House (or sitting) do now adjourn&#39;. In the Commons, however, debates on adjournment motions have covered almost every imaginable topic. This is because they have conventionally been used as a device to enable the House to discuss a particular issue in general terms and without needing to make a specific decision at the end.

Nowadays these general debates often take place on the motion: &#39;That this House has considered [a specific issue]&#39;.

In the House of Lords, general debates can take place on a &#39;motion to take note&#39; of a particular matter, or by tabling a Question for Short Debate.</dd>

There is no equivalent in the House of Lords where the government cannot limit debating time.</dd>

                        <dd>Ballot Bills are a type of Private Members&#39; Bill used in the House of Commons.

At the start of each new parliamentary year, backbench MPs are invited to enter their names into a ballot. The few MPs who are lucky in the draw may each bring in a Bill of their choosing, known as a Ballot Bill. Ballot Bills take priority over other Private Members&#39; Bills when time is allocated for debates and so have a better chance of becoming law.

In the Lords, a Private Members&#39; Bill ballot takes place at the start of a session to decide the order in which the first 25 Private Members&#39; Bills will be introduced.</dd>

                        <dd>A Committee of the whole House is sometimes used instead of a Public Bill Committee for some or all of a Bill&#39;s committee stage in the Commons. It takes place in the main chamber and allows all MPs to take part in the debate and to vote on the Bill&#39;s contents.

When the House sits as a committee it is chaired by the Deputy Speaker from a seat at the Table of the House. Committees of the whole House are favoured for Bills of constitutional or ethical importance and for parts of the annual Finance Bill.</dd>

In the Commons this task is normally done by a small number of MPs in a Public Bill Committee. Occasionally it is done in the Chamber by a Committee of the whole House, as is usual in the Lords.</dd>

                        <dd>The EVEL process operated in the House of Commons from 2015 until its suspension in 2020. The standing orders relating to EVEL procedures were rescinded following a decision of the House on 13 July 2021.

While in use, EVEL was designed to ensure that legislation that affected only England, or England and Wales, was approved by a majority of MPs representing English constituencies, or English and Welsh constituencies. It also applied to legislation introducing a tax measure that affected only England, Wales and Northern Ireland, which had to be approved by a majority of MPs representing constituencies in those areas.

EVEL could be applied to a whole bill, specific clauses or schedules, Lords amendments, a statutory instrument, or specific Budget resolutions.

There were two tests that had be met for EVEL to apply:

* The first test was that the bill (or clause or schedule of the bill), statutory instrument or Budget resolution related exclusively to England (or England and Wales, or England, Wales and Northern Ireland).
* The second test was that it was “within devolved legislative competence”.  In other words, that the Scottish Parliament, the National Assembly for Wales or the Northern Ireland Assembly could legislate in their territories on the same matter.</dd>

In the House of Lords, debates on statutory instrument (SIs) can be held in either the Chamber or in Grand Committee. Decisions can be made in Grand Committee but divisions (votes) only take place in the Chamber. If the SI is debated (considered) in Grand Committee, it must be approved by a separate motion in the Lords Chamber at a later date (although this is usually done without further comment). If the debate takes place in the Chamber both discussion and approval can happen at the same time. All members of the Lords can attend and speak in Grand Committee, it refers to the location rather than a specific committee with a limited membership.</dd>

                        <dd>‘Henry VIII clauses’ are clauses in a bill that enable ministers to amend or repeal provisions in an Act of Parliament using secondary legislation, which is subject to varying degrees of parliamentary scrutiny.

The Lords Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee pays particular attention to any proposal in a bill to use a Henry VIII clause because of the way it shifts power to the executive.

The expression is a reference to King Henry VIII&#39;s supposed preference for legislating directly by proclamation rather than through Parliament.</dd>

It is placed on the table of the House, except when the House is in committee, when it rests on two brackets underneath the table.

The Lords uses two maces, one dating from the time of Charles II and another from the reign of William III. One of the maces accompanies the Lord Speaker into the Chamber and is placed on the Woolsack whenever the House meets. The mace is absent from the Lords during the State Opening when the Monarch is in the Chamber in person.</dd>

                        <dd>Negative procedure is a type of parliamentary procedure that applies to statutory instruments (SIs). Its name describes the form of scrutiny that the SI receives from Parliament.

An SI laid under the negative procedure becomes law on the day the Minister signs it and automatically remains law unless a motion – or ‘prayer’ – to reject it is agreed by either House within 40 sitting days. Certain SIs on financial matters are only considered by the Commons.</dd>

Decisions made &#39;on the nod&#39; are decisions made with no debate or division (vote). The Chair simply reads out the question to be decided and takes an oral vote. If there are no objections, the question is recorded as having been agreed to.

A decision taken on the nod is generally on a non-contentious question or one whose points of contention have been - or will be - addressed at another time.</dd>

                        <dd>Pairing is an arrangement between two MPs of opposing parties to not vote in a particular division. This enables an MP to be absent without affecting the result of the vote as they effectively cancel each other out. Pairing is an informal arrangement which is not recognised by the House of Commons but must be registered with the Whips. Pairing is not allowed in divisions of great political importance.</dd>

2. The Standing Orders which are the rules under which Parliament conducts its business and regulates the way Members behave and debates are organised.
3. In the House of Commons Rulings from the Chair relate to decisions on procedure which have been referred to the Speaker for clarification. In the House of Lords, procedure is developed by the House itself through the Procedure Committee which considers any proposals for changes to Standing Orders.
4. Other proceedings are controlled by Acts of Parliament which cover such things as taking the Oath or presenting Bills to Parliament.</dd>

* important in terms of public policy

There is no equivalent in the House of Lords where the government cannot limit debating time.

Before the introduction of programming in the Commons, governments could only curtail the debate at a particular stage of a Bill by use of an Allocation of Time (or &#39;guillotine&#39;) motion.</dd>

When the Minister proposes to use the negative procedure, the statutory instrument (SI)  must be laid in draft for consideration, also known as “sifting”, by the European Statutory Instrument Committee in the Commons and the Secondary Legislation Scrutiny Committee in the Lords. At this stage the SI is called a proposed negative statutory instrument.

Each Committee will consider if the procedure is appropriate to the content of the instrument and make a recommendation in its weekly report. After committee consideration,  the Government will either sign the SI into law (make it) and then lay it as a made negative SI, or lay it as a draft affirmative SI.</dd>

Draft remedial orders are considered by the Joint Committee on Human Rights and then need to be approved by both Houses to become law. Urgent orders may be made without advance scrutiny, but they will stop being law if they are not approved by both Houses within 120 days of being laid before Parliament.</dd>

Despite its name, the 1922 Committee was actually set up in April 1923 following an initiative by new Conservative MPs elected at the 1922 General Election to facilitate cooperation within the party.</dd>

It is the party whips, along with the Leader and Shadow Leaders of each House, that negotiate behind the scenes to arrange the day to day business in Parliament - a process often referred to as &#39;the usual channels&#39;.

The Chief Whip of a party is a senior position and they are usually involved in top-level party discussions.</dd>
