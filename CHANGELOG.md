# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

As far as this project is concerned, a _breaking change_ is one that requires the user to change the HTML file manually, or that might break existing formatting.
For breaking changes, the major version is increased.
This applies from version 0.5.0 onwards, as some versions before that have broken this rule.

## [Unreleased]

## [5.2.1] - 2024-12-09

### Fixed

- Make `Browser.application` hack more reliable, as v5.2.0 had accidentally been released with a bug that broke the ability to open a glossary file in the browser.

## [5.2.0] - 2024-12-09

### Changed

- Improve performance.
- Improve styling.
  - Increase background/foreground contrast for a number of elements.
  - Change styling of index of terms.

- Allow setting a default theme. This is used if the user has not explicitly picked a theme, and has also not indicated a preference for dark mode in their browser settings.

### Changed

- Allow viewing a glossary file directly in a browser (using a `file://` URL), instead of showing only a help message. This restores functionality that was lost from version 4.0.0 onwards (see #11 for context).

## [5.0.3] - 2024-07-17

### Changed

- Upgrade GitHub Actions.

- When using the `worker.min.js` script, ensure that items are sorted by the IDs of their disambiguated preferred terms.

## [5.0.2] - 2024-06-21

### Fixed

- Fix bug that always switched on saving changes in memory.
- Fix instructions visibility issue when `file:` URL is opened.

## [5.0.1] - 2024-06-21

This version contains the changes that were originally released in 4.7.0 (and then temporarily reverted in 4.7.1).

The **breaking** change is that there are now stricter validation rules around preferred and alternative terms. In particular, a preferred term cannot also appear as an alternative term in any item.

If your glossary does not violate this rule then upgrading should hopefully be easy. Otherwise, you can follow the steps below.

1. Upgrade to 5.0.1
2. Edit the glossary and save without making any changes
3. If this doesn't get past the validation, revert back to version 4.7.1 and then make the necessary changes
4. Go back to step 1.

### Changed

- Make link for scrolling back to top dynamically appear at bottom right when (probably) needed -- instead of always being visible at the top left.
- Open external links in a new tab.
- Show at most 40 search results.
- Upgrade KaTeX to version 0.16.10.
- Make the `worker.min.js` script more performant by removing UI specific concerns.

## [4.7.1] - 2024-06-21

This release brings back version 4.6.0. The changes for 4.7.0 should have been released as a new major version, as there are breaking changes.

## [4.7.0] - 2024-06-21

### Changed

- Make link for scrolling back to top dynamically appear at bottom right when (probably) needed -- instead of always being visible at the top left.
- Open external links in a new tab.
- Show at most 40 search results.
- Upgrade KaTeX to version 0.16.10.
- Make the `worker.min.js` script more performant by removing UI specific concerns.

## [4.6.0] - 2024-03-04

### Changed

- Make search also cover definitions.
- Support âŒ˜K for searching on macOS.
- Select first search result by default.
- Upgrade KaTeX to version 0.16.9.

### Fixed

- Fix issues with back/forward buttons.
- Stop using [:target](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:target) for styling item pointed to by fragment identifier, as it [doesn't work well with back/forward buttons](https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/639). Handle highlighting of item that has "focus" in JavaScript instead.
- Prevent having multiple items with the same fragment identifier. The fragment identifier for an item is its disambiguated preferred term, with spaces replaced by underscores.
- Prevent search item from being made active just because mouse pointer is already over it.

## [4.5.1] - 2024-02-13

### Fixed

- Fixed typo in test.

## [4.5.0] - 2024-02-13

### Added

- Add function for converting glossary JSON to HTML to experimental `worker.min.js` script.

### Changed

- Make it more obvious when a tag is being filtered by.
- Don't show tag being filtered by on item cards.
- Rename "Quick search" to just "Search" for consistency.

### Fixed

- Attempt to make jumping to fragment identifier more reliable on initial page load.

## [4.4.0] - 2024-01-24

### Added

- Include tags in Markdown export.
- Add experimental `worker.min.js` script to releases.

## [4.3.0] - 2024-01-08

### Added

- Allow exporting to JSON.

### Fixed

- Restore initial instructions for opening/editing a glossary. These were no longer being shown if the file was being opened directly in a browser (using a `file://` URL).

## [4.2.0] - 2023-12-16

### Added

- When viewing a single item, show its (disambiguated) preferred term in the page title.

### Changed

- Move all UI text to `Internationalisation` directory to facilitate translations (see issue #10).

### Fixed

- Fix minor bug where changes were applied in memory even if saving failed.
- Don't show select menu for disambiguation tag if there are no tags.
- Fix bug where button for making changes in memory was wrongly hidden.

## [4.1.0] - 2023-11-30

This release contains a (very minor) **breaking** change that only affects a specific scenario when editing a glossary. This scenario occurs when you reload the page if the URL contains query parameters (which are now used to store which tag is being filtered by and the item sort order). The Node.js script for the editor does not currently cope with query parameters and needs a small tweak -- please see below.

### How to upgrade from v4.0.0

1. Point the [static assets](https://github.com/hilverd/glossary-page-template#static-assets) to a version starting with `@4` or `@4.1`.
2. In the Node.js script at the bottom of the file, replace

```
var filePath = '.' + req.url;
```

with

```
var filePath = '.' + req.url.replace(/\?.*$/g, '');
```

### Added

- Support tags in Anki export.
- Use URL query parameter to save tag being filtered by.
- Show a warning in edit mode if there are more than 500 items, which is currently not recommended for performance reasons.

### Changed

- When creating a new item, if a tag is being filtered by then auto-tick that tag's checkbox.
- Use URL query parameter for `order-items-by` instead of `localStorage`.

### Fixed

- Fix minor HTML/UI bug -- don't give IDs to alternative terms, to prevent duplicates.
- Make clicking on a tag to filter by also scroll to the top.
- Improve formatting when exporting to Markdown.

## [4.0.0] - 2023-11-24

This release introduces support for _tags_, improves support for items that have terms in common, and removes support for "plain text" in favour of Markdown. It contains **breaking** changes that should only affect you if

* you have items with multiple definitions or are using plain text, or
* you are opening the glossary as a file in a browser (using a `file://` URL).

The latter now only shows the (initial) help message, and to see the actual glossary you will need to either use the built-in editor or "host" the `glossary.html` file using e.g. `python3 -m http.server 8000`.

Download [glossary.html](https://github.com/hilverd/glossary-page-template/releases/latest/download/glossary.html) to see some examples of the new features.

### How to upgrade from v3

1. Point the [static assets](https://github.com/hilverd/glossary-page-template#static-assets) to a version starting with `@4`.
2. If you were using plain text rather than Markdown, then inspect all terms and definitions and correct the formatting where needed.
3. Similarly, if you had items with multiple definitions, then you will want to inspect their definitions and correct the formatting where needed.

### Added

- Add support for tags.
  - You can use these to attach "labels" to items that people can then filter by. This may be useful for large glossaries that span multiple topics, where there is a need to categorize or group items. Tags can also be used to "disambiguate" items that have the same preferred term but whose meaning depends on some "context". For example, the term "default" has a different meaning in the context of computer science than it does in the context of finance.
- Add a small "Built using Glossary Page Template" footer to the list page.
- Add keyboard shortcut "e" for making changes.
- Show spinner while saving changes.

### Changed

- Only allow one definition per item, but allow items to have alternative terms in common.
- Make the concept of a _preferred term_ (and _alternative terms_) clearer in the UI.
- Show "Make changes" button when Node.js backend is running. This is to make it easier to see the glossary in "read-only" mode.

### Removed

- Remove support for plain text syntax in favour of Markdown.

## [3.8.0] - 2023-10-13

### Added

- Allow hiding "Order items" buttons in Settings.

### Changed

### Changed

### Added

- Add logo to home page.

### Changed

- Use logo for favicons.

## [3.6.0] - 2023-08-09

### Added

- Allow ordering items "focused on" a particular term. Items that are closely related to this term (i.e. have a shorter path to the term's item via "See also" links) are shown earlier. For larger glossaries, this hopefully provides a way to focus on a certain topic by allowing the user to browse the items closely related to that topic, gradually moving towards topics that are further removed.

### Changed

- Upgrade KaTeX to version 0.16.8.

### Fixed

- Fix minor layout bug for "This field can't be empty" message.

## [3.5.2] - 2023-07-11

- Fix bug where last updated date was not changing in "View as single item" modal dialog.

## [3.4.1] - 2023-06-25

### Added

- Add "View as single item" button on each card. This is available on "larger" screens and is meant to help make longer descriptions more readable.

### Changed

- Backfill last updated dates for example glossaries.

## [3.3.1] - 2023-06-13

### Added

- Save "order items" choice across browser sessions.

### Fixed

- Rename "most frequent first" to "most mentioned first" for clarity.
- Improve print layout.

### Added

- Support a Markdown-based syntax for the glossary title and for terms (not just term descriptions).
- When Markdown is enabled, support _math typesetting_ using [KaTeX](https://katex.org/).
  - See the Settings menu for how to enable this.
  - Inline math is written by surrounding an expression with dollar signs inside a code fragment: ` $e = mc^2$ `.
  - Display math is written using code blocks whose language is declared as `math`:

  ````
  ```math
  e = mc^2
  ```
  ````

### Fixed

- Make links in Markdown content not "tabbable" if a modal dialog is shown.

## [2.1.0] - 2023-03-11

### Added

- Close menu for mobile when escape key is pressed.
- Respect `prefers-reduced-motion` for mobile menu.
- Respect `prefers-contrast: more` on index page.

### Changed

- The term index now lists all terms that do not contain an alphabetic character (with or without diacritics) under `â€¦`.
- Separate multiple definitions by a dotted line.

### Fixed

- Fix bug in logic for writing back to HTML file. Dollar signs need to be escaped.

## [2.0.0] - 2023-02-20

The main change in this release is that it introduces support for a _Markdown-based syntax_. Using that syntax, term definitions can now contain multiple paragraphs, bold/italic text, ordered/unordered lists, hyperlinks, images, code fragments, and more.

### How to upgrade from v1 and switch to Markdown

1. Point the [static assets](https://github.com/hilverd/glossary-page-template#static-assets) to a version starting with `@2`.

3. Inspect all term definitions and correct the formatting where needed.

### Added

- Support a [Markdown](https://commonmark.org/help/)-based syntax for term descriptions.
  - This uses [elm-markdown](https://github.com/dillonkearns/elm-markdown) which implements [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://github.github.com/gfm/).

- Add a "Settings" section on the list page which allows changing the following.
  - How "compact" the overall layout is by adjusting the card widths.
  - Whether a Markdown-based syntax is enabled.
  - Whether the "Export" menu should be shown.

### Changed

- Switch to Source Sans 3 font. The Overpass font has [undesired behaviour for backticks](https://github.com/RedHatOfficial/Overpass/issues/95).
- Restrict item height and show a scrollbar for longer items, depending on overall layout determined by `data-card-width`.

### Fixed

    1. Download the `glossary.html` template from the [latest release](https://github.com/hilverd/glossary-page-template/releases/latest).
    2. Copy the entire `<dl>...</dl>` element from your existing glossary and replace the `<dl>...</dl>` element in the newest template.
    3. Change the title and about section using the built-in editor.

## [0.5.0] - 2022-02-20

- Scroll back to item after editing it.

## [0.4.1] - 2022-02-18
